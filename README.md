M- allows you to book a ticket for the outdoor cinema. You could pick a movie and date/time through this website. You could also review your booked tickets as well. Additionally, you may browse the movies through the Genre filtering or the Search Bar with just any keyword (actor names, title, genre; etc...). 
On top of everything, you need to be logged in with your GitHub account before you make your booking.
